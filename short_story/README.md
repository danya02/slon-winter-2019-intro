# TL;DR: [this file](outp.md)

This took quite a while, because, as with every creative writing task, I've overdone the requirements.
Quoth `wc`:

```
$ wc --word outp.md
5440 outp.md
$ perl -e 'print(5440/1200);'
4.53333333333333
$ # woot!
```

At least this time, instead of writing my own template engine [like last time](https://github.com/danya02/slon-2018-lit-club), I've used Jinja to inset the names and the formatting effects.
