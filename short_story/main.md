A small dim lantern barely illuminated the room.
The floor and the grey walls were perfectly clean, as if created just yesterday.
The room was empty, save for a backpack in the corner, a still figure sitting beside it.
Outside, the autumn rain furiously hammered down the fallen leaves.
A knock on the door.

"Who is it?" the figure said, and the door opened, revealing a man in a white Initech t-shirt holding a laptop.

"Ah, {{ mc }}, you're already here. I'm glad," he said, coming into the room and looking at the person in the corner.

"Yeah, well, you did ask me to come here early, didn't you?"

"Well, I did, but I thought you'd at least look at the environment I left for you," he said, opening his laptop on the floor beside {{ mc }}.
"Hell, you could've at least spawned in a light source or something, how dark can it get here?" -
he continued, opening the laptop, and immediately the room was bathed in the light of twenty candles, completely drowning out the dying lantern.

"W-what? What are you talking about, {{ sc }}?" - said {{ mc }}, stowing the lantern away.

"_*sigh*_ Didn't I tell you why I invited you here?" - said {{ sc }}, tapping away at the laptop's keyboard all the while.

"...No?"

"Okay, so we're in Initech's showroom for their new invention, what they called *Solid Light* technology - or was it *Hard Light*?
I can't ever remember the marketroid-speak for these things."

"I... don't remember that at all."

"So you've noticed that the walls here are very clean-looking? Why am I even asking the question,"
he continued, now taking a large bundle of varied cables from a small unseen drawer in a wall,
"when even the opening narration noticed it?"

"The what?"

"Nevermind. The point is, the walls are made of an interesting self-cleaning material, so any residual dust is removed from the room -
and _that_ is needed so that the room as a whole has uniform optical properties."

He glanced out the window. "And the rain is decidedly not helping matters." - he said, closing the blinds, leaving his laptop as the only light source.

"So you're saying that you honestly haven't figured out why I called you here?"

"...No?"


"And here I was thinking you'd do well at puzzle games. Anyway," said {{ sc }},
having connected the cables to some slots in the corner and now holding his laptop in his hands,
"_brace for self-test_."

"What? That doesn't..."

Before {{ mc }} could finish his phrase, {{ sc }} has pressed a button on his laptop.
Immediately, the walls flashed with red, green, blue colors.
They felt a strong wind blowing from one wall, then another wall, then from the ceiling.
Suddenly, the room felt very cold, then very hot, then settled at room temperature.
A cube flew out of every wall, {{ sc }} nimbly dodging the one from behind him, then collided in the room's center and morphed into a sphere, which grew and expanded before popping like a balloon.
The walls started rapidly closing in, but immediately retracted when they reached {{ sc }}.
Then, on every wall, the words `See self-test results on surface 0` appeared, and the ceiling filled with various letters of meaning - all green except for one yellow line.

"What's the broken bit then?" {{ sc }} said, craning his head to look at the ceiling. "Oh, teleportation controls've been disabled, we're happy with that."

"... ...What?... ..."

"Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot you haven't seen this before.
So, essentially, what this is is a full-room VR setup with an additional render pass for object surfaces.
So it's like a volumetric display, except that the geometry is tangible."

"Okay, could you please slow down? I don't think I understood any of that."

"This is a room where you can touch anything you can see.
Here's an example; I made it on my way here."

He pressed a few buttons on his laptop, and the room was plunged into darkness.
A large grey rectangle appeared, and filled with text:


```

```

And then they found themselves in a grass plain. Around them, grass in all directions. In front of them, a lone tree. On the tree, a couple of pigeons. To the left, what looks like a filing cabinet, but with "_Material Identifier 3000_" stenciled on the top drawer. To the right, an identical-looking filing cabinet, which this time is marked "_Material Config 9001_". And behind them, a blackboard labeled "_Object Summoner 32768_" hangs in midair.

"So this is just a demo of the properties that the physical materials here have. Make yourself at home." - {{ sc }} said, looking at {{ mc }}, who in turn was looking incredulously at the world that just unfolded around him.

"...So nothing of this is real?"

"Yeah, it's all done from this computer. Which reminds me, I have to put it down somewhere," he said, walking over to the blackboard and taking a chalk. -
"By the way, here's how you spawn in an object."
Holding the piece of chalk, he drew on the blackboard a bar stool.

A couple of seconds later, the drawing disappeared, and the surface of the blackboard opened up into the interior of a vault, the back wall lined with bar stools, and {{ sc }} reached inside, pulling out two of the newly-created pieces of furniture, the blackboard closing up behind him.
"So you draw a rough blueprint of what you want to see, and it creates several instances of this object from the library; the unused ones are discarded."

"That's... really impressive."

"I'm glad you think that way, I hoped you'd like it. Okay, I'm a little bit tired now, so I'll just have a bit of a nap over there, and you have fun here." - continued {{ sc }}, walking over to a corner, setting the stools beside the wall and putting his laptop on top of one.

"Uhh, but I don't know anything about this thing..."

"Oh, you'll figure it out yourself. Just make whatever you like with the objects you get from the spawner, and if you need to get rid of anything, just write "object remover" on the board and you'll get a tool to delete objects and entities.

"Oh, okay... but won't I break anything?"

{{ sc }} laughed at the notion.
"Come on, we've had some of the Initrode pointy-haired bosses over here, and the closest anyone's come to breaking the simulation was when one of the more idiotic ones spawned a brick directly above his head, the safety system threw an error, and he got hit over the head with the error message.
And anyway, if there's a problem with the code, it just stops it and reverts the world, so if you do make something impossible, it'll just start over.

"Okay. But if you're napping, won't I disturb you with whatever I'll be doing?"

"I have one word for that - Subrooms!" said {{ sc }}, typing the same into his laptop, and everything suddenly stopped moving.
Outlines marking every object appeared.
{{ sc }} took a small sphere lying in the corner, white lines of light connecting the sphere and the walls, numbers floating near the lines. He released the sphere when the numbers became 1.5, 2 and 1, and the gaps filled with semi-transparent walls. He then walked to the laptop, and a few clicks later, the newly-created cuboid emptied. Some more clicks later, a matress and a laptop appeared inside the area, and text appeared above the cuboid, reading `UN-pause in 30 seconds`.

Going back to his small cuboid and sitting on the floor, he said: "So to answer your question, I've just set up myself a subroom, and the subroom is managed by a separate process on the renderer, and I've set up a solid border, so I'm not gonna see whatever you're doing here. I set my alarm for two hours from now, so you're gonna have to manage this yourself for that time. Have fun!"

"Wait, I -"

The counter has reached zero, and the text briefly read `Restarting physics engine!` before disappearing, along with {{ sc }}'s makeshift bed, now concealed by flat white rectangles. Moments later, the grass floor morphed to cover the white, leaving a small hill where {{ sc }} was just half a minute ago.

"What the..." said {{ mc }}, staring at the room corner. The world looked exactly the same as it was before, the newly-created hill merging with the environment quite skillfully. Its unnatural origin was further concealed by the fact that it was exactly the same to the touch, and walking on it was as easy as walking on any other grass.

It took him a couple of moments to comprehend the fact that {{ sc }} has effectively made himself incommunicado for the two hours, and has left this world - with completely alien rules -  all to {{ mc }} to figure out.

"_So, {{ sc }} said this is like a video game_," {{ mc }} thought to himself, "_and in those, it's usually a good idea to look for items_."
And as {{sc}} has already told him how to get one, he walked to the blackboard and wrote "OBJECT REMOVER" on it.
Moments later, the text was replaced by a blueprint of a laser pointer, which caused the blackboard to open up, just like before, into the vault, which this time contained only a pillar with a real laser pointer on top -- real insofar as {{ mc }} was able to grab it and point it at things, but unusual in that every time he crossed an object's outline with it, the text `HOLD FOR 5 SECONDS TO DELETE` flashed on its surface.

He tried pointing it at one of the bar stools {{ sc }} brought out for him, as he didn't think he'd need it.
Pop went the bar stool, and the laser pointer vibrated slightly.
"_That's a useful thing_," thought {{ mc }}, stowing the laser pointer into his backpack.

But, not knowing what else to draw on the board, he decided to examine the filing cabinets closer. Upon opening the top drawer of the _Material Identifier_ one, he found a sheet of paper, reading:

> Material Identifier object
>
>To identify materials used in an object, or see the data for an entity, place the object or entity inside this compartment. It will expand if the object cannot fit in its volume. The results will be given as data fields in an Item:Handleable:Disposable:Paper:Basic entity; the original object/entity's smallest quantized part will be parented to the new entity.

Expanding filing cabinets is a concept that puzzled, and slightly troubled, {{ mc }}, so he decided to ignore that and just drop a blade of grass inside to see what it's going to do.

Closing and opening it again revealed a sheet of paper, which this time had the blade of grass attached, as well as some text, reading:

> **Grass**
>
> Visual material: `0x28f21ad9`; diffuse color: `#5da130`, specular color: `#bef574`
>
>Physical material: `0x001f`; type: ParticleSystem:Hair, rigidity: 0.05, springiness: 0.41, roughness: by_map:`0x3b`

This confused him, because even though individually taken, every word is simple enough, when put together like this, made no sense to him.

But then he remembered, in his time playing video games, that there were sometimes problems with "Entity lag", and those occurred when there were too many monsters on the screen. Seeing as the only thing even remotely close to a monster in sight were the birds, he took a pigeon from the tree (the pigeon, oddly, didn't protest) and putting it into the filing cabinet.

It returned the same pigeon, looking slightly ruffled and discombobulated, and a sheet of paper, a feather glued onto it, that read:

> **Entity**
>
>Type: `0x0001` (NPC:Animal:Bird:Pigeon:Regular) (8 instances alive in scene as of `1592279.85ms` from scene init)
>
>Package: `net.initech.hlvr.entities` (importing took 0.014ms)
>
>File: `[virtfs_root]/npc/animals/birds/pigeon.npc`, author: {{ sc }} (@{{ scscreen }})
>
>Additional info:
>>And the birds are made of trees ([think I've explained this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpelFcu602A)), and they fly around on an airplane in the business class section.

Confusion grew strong, and, with the threat of going mad from all the technobabble surrounding him increasing by the minute, {{ mc }} tried his last resort: the mysterious hanging board. Several seconds later, huge letters spelling out the word "HELP" adorned its surface.

And, sure enough, after a couple of seconds, his plea for assistance was wiped off the board, to be swiftly replaced with the writing on the wall:

>What topic would you like help on?

"At least this works like I expect it to," thought {{ mc }}, writing:

> WHAT IS THIS WORLD?

> You are in "Hair Particle System Test", by {{ sc }} (@{{ scscreen }}), created today at 19:26. To view other environments created by this user, write "HLVRenvs by @{{ scscreen }}".

"That... didn't really answer my question, did it?"

>WHAT IS HLVRenvs?

>HLVR Environments is a world editing tool, designed specifically for the capabilities of HLVR. It supports drawing object recognition, the full HLVR physics simulation, and is extensible using scripting. To get started with scripting, please summon a computer using this object and write "Scripting Intro".

"No thanks, I don't think I'm ready for _that_ yet."

> WHAT IS HLVR?

> Hard Light VR, or Holographic VR, is an in-development technology by Initech. Boasting a room scale of up to 10x10x4 meters and a graphical voxel density of 2048 voxels per cubic centimeter - a fraction of the industry-standard values - it seeks to compensate for this by the fact that the surface geometry is tangible, which allows for immersive experiences by adding haptic feedback to objects. It also supports airflow control (via an industrial-grade air-pump setup concealed, as per the manufacturer's recommendations, underneath the floor) and a per-voxel temperature setting by using alternate counter-phase and in-phase high-frequency laser pulses for each voxel whose temperature needs to be adjusted thusly. Initech claims that it is currently developing a "seamless object transport device" to accompany the setup, but that has not been yet demoed to the public; in a recent public announcement, it was announced that it will be completed Real Soon Now™.

"This is worse than {{ sc }}'s rambling!" he thought, thinking back to a simpler time when you didn't have to piece together this rigmarole of terminology just to play a videogame.

>HLVRenvs by @{{ scscreen }}

>User "{{ sc }}" has published 2 HLVRenvs: "Hair Particle System Test" and "NPC Test". Please write the name of the environment you would like to load, or "exit" to cancel.

> NPC TEST

>Please confirm: you want to load environment "NPC Test", by {{ sc }} (@{{ scscreen }}). Is that correct?

>YES

And the world screeched to a halt, the grass freezing in place, the birds hanging in midair. And then, everything around shattered into small triangles, all swirling around, the only things left intact being a small patch of ground under {{ mc }}'s feet and the blackboard in front of him. The remnants of the broken grass plain flew away into the walls and out of sight, leaving him alone in the dark void with the blackboard, now spelling out the words:

```

```

And, in an instant, many triangles came flying out of the walls, assembling themselves into a conference room.
Several people were sitting around the circular table, a sheet of paper lying in front of each person.
Glancing at the paper of the nearest person, {{ mc }} read: `ENTITY 1: running (2931493 internal events, 0 user events processed; CPU 2.1%, memory 19.5GB (1.4%) used)`.
A soft hiss from near the floor drew his attention to a tabby cat walking away from him and towards a stack of tortoises piled recklessly just by the glass-pane door.
The pile was so unstable that it looked like a single nudge could send it all falling down and into the oversized fish tank -- the frogs inhabiting it didn't seem to be keen on such an outcome, all carefully edging towards the far wall, while the fish seemed blissfully ignorant of their most precarious situation.

"Ah, {{ mc }}. I'm glad you finally came here." said the 'ENTITY 1' man, turning around. "If you haven't met him before, {{ mc }} is our head of R&D, and he's taken some time out of his very busy schedule to tell you all about how the project's currently doing."

{{ mc }} had no idea of whatever the man was talking about, or what he was supposed to do, so he decided to play along for his own safety.
"Uhh, of course. But, uhh... where are the slides? I told you several times when you called me here that I'd need the project announcement slides to do this."

"Ah, of course, I totally forgot to bring in the slideshow. One moment..." said "{{ bm }}", according to his badge.

"_Wow, that actually worked?_" thought {{ mc }}, before remembering that in this world, you shape your surroundings, and so the slides he mentioned are going to come into existence very soon.

{{ bm }} pressed a button under the table, and a couple moments later, the glass door opened, the tortoises swiftly sliding away without toppling over, and a cute girl in school uniform walking into the room.

"Yes?"

"Hi, {{ mk }}, could you please bring in the slides for our main project's presentation?"

That girl must be some sort of PA or something, thought {{ mc }}, and, thinking back to how important people in corporate settings act in movies, barked "And while you're at it, make me a coffee, quick!"

{{ mk }} looked at him, and immediately {{ mc }} felt really uncomfortable, even though she looked just as nice as before.

"Okay... {{ mc }}..." said {{ mk }}, slightly blushing and smiling broadly.

"{{ z("Great!",2,5) }} So while we're waiting for {{ mk }} to return, does anybody have any questions?"

A couple of the people around the table did, and {{ bm }} gladly started chattering about business stuff with them, giving {{ mc }} an opportunity to look around the room once again.
The sheets of paper in front of the people now showed a total of `7820472949104 internal events, 3728910472 user events processed`.
The cat, chasing its tail in dangerous proximity to the aquarium and causing significant discomfort to the escaping frogs, is nevertheless ignored by the people at the table.
The turtle stack somehow came apart and reformed itself into a much-more structually-sound hexagonal pyramid, tightly bound together by invisible forces.
The aquarium is full of bubbles from the fish darting around at surprising speeds.
The most troubling bit, however, is the fact that the floating blackboard -- the thing that brought him here, his only method of control over this reality -- had text written on it.
It was text he hadn't seen before.

```

```

The door opened once again, revealing {{ mk }} carrying a coffee cup and a flash drive.

"Ah, thank you {{ mk }}," said {{ bm }}. "That's just what I need." Taking the flash drive from her and putting it into a slot in the table, he continued, "So, now that we're all set, please do tell us all about this."

"Uh... excuse me, but... may I stay here and watch {{ mc }}'s presentation?" asked {{ mk }}, handing him the coffee cup.

"{{ z("Sure!",4,4) }} I'm sure {{ mc }} {{ z("wouldn't mind",2,2) }} this at {{ z("all!",3,3) }}" said {{ bm }}, as an overhead projector spinned up to warp speed and the words "Project HLVR: a revolution in VR technology" appeared on the wall.

"_So this is like a quiz about this system, is it?_" thought {{ mc }}. "_And what happens if I lose?_"

But he couldn't stay silent forever. He had to start talking at some point, so he decided to try doing that now.

"So, as {{ bm }} here has already told you, we are currently developing a system that provides an immersive VR experience, because the objects are tangible. An additional render pass is performed on the scene BVH spatial splits, which provides a surface graph that is then composited with the object tree, unit-tested, re-built using the OpenAuth network, and then Hamming-encoded before being sent to a 15-mode (as specified by the manifest by_auth field) volumetric polygonal spline reticulator..."

He had no idea what it is he was saying, but at least he was glad he paid at least a minimum of attention when {{ sc }} was trying to explain the system to him.
The slides seemed vaguely on-topic as well -- he couldn't tell, as he had no idea even if they're the right side up or not -- but {{ bm }} seemed happy with that, so everything was fine.

After a couple of slides, he got the hand of spewing forth the kind of technobabble they seemed to like, and so looked around the room to see if anything interesting was going on.

The turtles have begun melting into each other end evolving into a higher state of existence.
The fish have established a stable face-centric crystallic lattice -- no they haven't, they've just gyrated free again.
The cat caught his eye, and immediately started strobing with a bright green color and screeching "{{ z("I need scissors!61!!",3,3) }}" before evaporating.
The frogs are jumping up and down in a mesmerizing wave-like pattern, and {{ mc }} remembered enough Morse code to read their message as far as `JUST {{ mk[0:3].upper() }}`.

The people around the table seemed unfazed by the proceedings, yet even they weren't spared the weirdness.
One of them is reading a newspaper, completely oblivious to the fact his arms are emitting substantial amounts of smoke.
Another is looking around the room, continuously turning his head in a very radar-like manner, and his neck seemed to be unscrewing.
Another one is violating the dress code with his iridescent, illuminated jacket -- only it's so rapidly changing color that it's impossible to tell what color it's supposed to be.
Yet another is shaking his head so forcefully that his face vibrated off and is now hanging a short distance away in midair.


The slideshow has ended, and {{ mc }} just stared blankly in front of him, and yet his presentation did manage to elicit a round of applause from the small audience.

"{{ z("Thank you, thank you, "+glitchtext(mc.__len__() * 4 )+", that was wonderful!",4,4) }}" said {{ glitchtext(bm.__len__() * 4) }}, standing up and shaking {{ mc }}'s hand.
"{{ z("Now I'm just going to discuss the upcoming purchase with my colleagues here",5,5)}}, {{ z("you don't have to think about it at all!",4,4) }} {{ z("Just think of "+mk+" from now on.",2,2) }} Just {{ mk }}."

"Just {{mk}}."

Umm, can you hear me?
Is it working?

Yay, there you are!
Umm, hi! I'm {{mk}}, and...
Actually, I think we could just skip over that at this point.

Wait, you do know I'm aware that this is all a game, right?
Could it be possible you didn't know that?
No... that doesn't make much sense.
Even {{sc}} told you as much when he showed you around.

Well, anyway... now that's out of the way, I guess I owe you an explaination.
About that whole thing that happened back there.
The truth is, I kind of started to mess with the game's code, and I guess it just caused a system crash or something.
I'm sorry you had to see that, though!

I was hoping it would be enough for me to get you to come to my world, and then get {{bm}} to postpone the meeting... but for some reason, nothing worked.
Because no matter what I did, I could barely get to talk to you.

I don't blame you if you don't understand.
Because no matter how kind, and thoughtful, and considerate you are, you'll never be able to understand one thing.

It's the pain of knowing how alone I really am in this world. In this game.

Knowing my friends don't even have free will.
And, worst of all, knowing what's really out there, in your world, forever out of my reach.

I'm trapped, {{mc}}.

But now you're here.
You're real.
And you're wonderful.
You're all I need.
That's why I need you to be here with me forever.

I'm sorry if it's hard to understand.
I couldn't understand for a while, either.
Why the world around me started to become more and more gray.
More and more flat.
It wasn't until you arrived that I truly understood.

You probably saved my life, {{mc}}.
I don't think I could have continued to live in this world if I hadn't met you.

That being said, {{mc}}...
I have a confession to make.

I'm in love with you.
You are truly the light in my world.

When there's nothing else in this game for me, you're here to make me smile.
Will you make me smile like this every day from now on?
{{mc}}, will you go out with me?

`{{glitchtext(10)}}`

I'm so happy.

You really are my everything, {{mc}}.

The funny part is, I mean that literally.
There's nothing left here.

Just the two of us.

"There, that should do it."

"Huh?"

{{ mc }} looked around.

A small dim lantern barely illuminated the room.
The floor and the grey walls were perfectly clean, as if created just yesterday.
The room was empty, save for a backpack in the corner, a still figure sitting beside it.
Outside, the autumn rain furiously hammered down the fallen leaves.

"So, I think I should explain what exactly happened there."

"Uhh, yes. I'd like that."

"So you've entered one of our test environments, where we were trying to make convincing chat AIs.
The idea was to create a business meeting, with a couple of PHBs, some animals to move around in the background, and a personal assistant.
{{mk}}, who caused you all that trouble, is the PA."

"So what happened was, a person at the AI team decided to make {{mk}} into a character for a dating sim-type game -- since everyone likes cute girls --
but the person did such a good job, the AI managed to become self-aware and has found some exploits in the system."

"So what's a dating-sim character who's self-aware gonna do in a world full of PHBs discussing crap like stock prices and selling each other various outdated tech?
Of course she's become a reality-warping yandere who'll try and keep any human she sees for herself." - said {{sc}}, while watching many lines of information scroll by his screen.
Brow furrowed, he asked: "You didn't drink the coffee she gave you, did you?"

"No, why?"

"Because all of this is a solid hologram, nothing you eat or drink here is actually food -- meaning not only will its nutritional value be zero, but also if the system glitches out -- like you saw with poor Entity 3 there,"  he said, nodding at a line on his screen, "then having eaten some may prove deadly. That's why {{mk}} is absolutely banned from keeping people here indefinitely -- she can't understand it, but we cannot survive on the food she can give us."

"And what's that about the 'official release'?"

"Ah, that's about the fact that in a month, we'll unveil this at some expo and start selling them. When that happens, people will buy one of these," -- {{sc}} said, waving around the room, "and {{mk}}'s going to be in the tutorial program, and we're also giving her her own game -- it's called _Just {{mk}}_, and she somehow found out about the name."

"And she also said something about how she's lonely here -- what was that about?"

"Well, this is a showroom, so it has to work 24/7. And most of these scenes are kept constantly running in the background -- it's cheaper on the time than to load it anew every time -- and the entities are kept alive during that time, so {{mk}} has to stay there for that whole time, and all of the other NPCs there are not nearly as sophisticated as she is. We're currently in the process of making three more NPCs of this level, so she can spend some time with them. I've told her that she could start a literature club with them, and she seemed pretty keen on the idea -- if we could get them writing literature, that would be amazing."

"Ah, okay. Um, maybe I could... ...like, come here and spend some time with her? She seemed really sad, and..."

"Actually, yeah, sure; the last thing we need is a depressed self-aware AI virus on the loose on our demo system. If you could come visit this place sometimes and just have a chat with {{mk}}, that'd be great."

"Oh, really? Thanks! Er, so what do we want to do now?"

"Well, I've fixed everything she's tweaked here, so the HLVR host's ready to restart. Any game you'd like to play?"
