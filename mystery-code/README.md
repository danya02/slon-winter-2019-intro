# TL;DR: [this is the edited code](code.py)
AKA "The Gratuitous Transcription Error".

This code features 2-tuples of integers, the formula for the square of the Euclidean distance between two points and a maximum selector. From this, I conclude it's supposed to find the two nearest points.

If it's actually supposed to do that, it's not. It *was* not, but it's working now, and it lives [here](code.py).
