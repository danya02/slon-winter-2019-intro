# TL;DR: [here](https://github.com/boukeversteegh/pptpd-monitor/pull/9)
AKA "Not Enough Issues, So Little Time"

Yes, I know, the repo linked above is very much not actively maintained.
However, I've been using that program to monitor my PPTP server for a while, and I recently noticed how weirdly the arguments are parsed.
As it hasn't been a problem as-is, I didn't see that before, and I just thought it'd be a good thing to try to fix.

The [other](https://github.com/boukeversteegh/pptpd-monitor/pull/8) [two](https://github.com/boukeversteegh/pptpd-monitor/pull/7) pull requests
I made from several years ago, when the repo was marginally more active, might count as well.

The problem, as I've discovered, is to find a repo that is actively maintained, yet still has issues that I can fix that others haven't.
