# TL;DR: [this program](main.py).
AKA "ðŸ˜­".

As mentioned in the task description, this is made easy by the VK API, and access to that is made easy by the [`vk_api` library](https://pypi.org/project/vk_api/). But recursion is still a pain in the b`RAIN` to implement, and besides the program crashes if the target person has/appears to have zero friends (in which case you're either too paranoid or too antisocial to use this anyway).

As for myself, the paradox does work. To see for yourself, the target ID is [450410456](https://vk.com/danya023). As of this writing, I have 30 friends (I have no idea how I got that many), and even though two of my [friends](https://vk.com/id513704381) are [bots](https://vk.com/id513710161) I use for miscellaneous nefarious purposes which don't have many friends, the fact that I also have a [friend](https://vk.com/vorontsovie) with *581* friends means that it will take making many more friends to make this paradox not work. (Keep in mind that some of these friends will actually hinder this task!)
