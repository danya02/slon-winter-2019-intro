# TL;DR: [this script](main.py)
AKA "Code Reusal"

I mean, come on. This exact task was a necessary part of [an earlier task](https://github.com/danya02/slon-summer-2018-intro/tree/master/gurps_calculator), so why would you add this task *not a year after the last one?!*

I'm not complaining though, as it means that I don't have to reinvent the wheel.
